#Early Literacy
Young Children need a variety of skills to become successful readers. Early literacy skills become the building blocks for later reading and writing. We will focus on vocabulary, print motivation, print awareness, narrative skills, letter knowledge, and phonics in an atmosphere that is fun, verbal and stimulating.

#Math
Math skills will be developed with handsâ€”on experiences as the children work on counting, sorting, comparing, classifying and measuring.

#Science
To incorporate science into an early childhood classroom is to "find" the science in daily activities that we are already doing. Children will conduct investigations, collect data, observe, classify, ask questions and problem solve.

#Faith Building
No doctrine is taught as we come together from different dominations but our goal is to partner with parents and guide the children on their spiritual journey. We will create a caring and loving Christian atmosphere in the classroom. Children will be participating in bible stories and songs weekly.

#Music and Movement
Each week, children participate in our Music Program. Our music resource teacher introduces basic music concepts and instruments . Students experience music though the skills of singing, playing a variety of instruments, listening, movement, creating "effect" and rhythms. Through these experiences, students will gain an appreciation for music and participation in the movement of making music.

#Cooking
In an early childhood classroom, cooking is an integral part of science, math, social studies and language development. Each week students participate in the cooking program "Seed to Table". Children will be cooking produce from their own organic garden. It is our goal to teach children the value of nutritional food preparation and consumption.

#Foreign Language
Each week students in the three, four and five year old classes will participate in our Spanish language development program. The Spanish language resource teacher will introduce basic conversational language. Students will develop an appreciation for the Spanish culture through discussions and interactive activities.

#Art
Art is a very crucial part of preschool. Art allows children to be creative while developing small/large motor skills and eye hand coordination. Children will be allowed to express their ideas through art each week. We look at the process not the product. Various mediums will be introduced: clay, tempera paint, finger paint, chalk, crayons, tinsels, watercolors, scissors, sculpture and collages. Students will develop an awareness of colors and color mixing.

#Organic Gardening
Preschool children are connected to their food supply through a unique "seed to table" curriculum centered on a working garden. Children will learn to grow, harvest and prepare nutritious seasonal produce. Children will become familiarized with healthy food and snack choices. It allows the children to learn skills in a variety of subjects such as math, science and language arts. Our garden specialist will be on site monthly to teach special gardening techniques to the children.

#Yoga
Yoga is an exercise that focuses on deep breathing, strength, flexibility and balance. Children will develop body awareness, language, good listening skills, group cooperation and how to calm the mind. Our program is designed to inspire both the active bodies and playful imaginations of children. 

#Summer Camp  
Our summer camp will run for 4 weeks during the month of July. Registration forms will be available in March.
