# Our Philosophy  

#### Where the Garden Grows is a private Preschool in Fresno committed to providing an early childhood education in a warm and loving environment, carefully designed to nurture the child's growth as an individual with respect for self and others. Our goal is to provide opportunities for meaningful play.  
#### Our school enhances the development of social, emotional, and intellectual skills, as well as physical ability and spiritual awareness. Each area of development is interrelated and affects the child's sense of self. It is our commitment to help each child form a positive self-concept and to develop self-discipline.  
#### A dedicated staff provides each child with endless opportunities to think, explore, ask questions and to enjoy the learning experience. Our program provides meaningful literacy and life skilled curriculum that is developmentally appropriate.
