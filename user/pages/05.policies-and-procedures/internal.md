#WTGG IS A PEANUT/NUT FREE ENVIRONMENT!
We ask that you do not send any peanut/nut products to school with your child that will be eaten in the classroom. If your child has eaten peanuts or nuts before coming to school, please be sure your child's hands and face have been thoroughly washed before entering the school.

#Library Policies and Procedures
Children will be given an opportunity to check out a library book on a designated day each week. Each book must be returned in order to check out another book. Parental support is genuinely appreciated in the maintenance and care of these books. It is our desire for the children to become aware of the pleasure and responsibility of borrowing a library book. In the case of a lost book parents will be responsible for the replacement cost.


#Valet Service Procedures
A staff member will unload child and assist him/her to the classroom. Parent/guardian must sign in and out sheet. At the end of the half day schedule, the reverse will apply. A staff member will escort child to the car and help him/her aboard. Don't park your car in driveways or anywhere else it will interfere with a safe, speedy efficient drop off and pick up of children. If you choose to not use valet service or arrive after designated valet service time (8:45) please park in the back of the school campus and personally walk child to the appropriate classroom. Do not allow child to walk unescorted to the classroom.

If you wish to stay an extended period of time please prearrange with the teacher. Please make arrangements for child care of any siblings during your visit.

#Parent/Teacher Communication
A school newsletter and calendar will be published monthly. The newsletter and calendar is intended to acquaint you with the upcoming month's activities and events. We encourage our parents to participate in special events and volunteer any talents they may have to offer. If you wish to have a conference with your child's teacher regarding progress or concerns, please feel free to contact her by email or through our office voicemail. A mutually agreeable time will be arranged.

#Clothing
Please send a complete change of clothing in a zip-lock bag labeled with your child's name that can be kept at school for those awkward moments. Please label all children's apparel. Select comfortable, washable play clothing for your children. Children occasionally will stain their clothing despite our best efforts. Tennis shoes should be worn by all children to ensure easy creative movement and safe play on the playground.

#Refillable Water Bottles
All children need to bring daily a water bottle that is labeled with their name.

#Snacks
Parents have a choice, they may send a nutritional snack and drink with their child to school for our morning and/or afternoon snack or Where The Garden Grows will provide a snack. To accommodate the nutritional and cultural needs of each child, Where The Garden Grows strives to partner with families. It is important to indicate any special dietary needs (i.e. allergies or cultural/religious food preferences) on enrollment forms. Children may not share snacks.

#Drop In Students
Drop-ins who are enrolled at Where The Garden Grows Preschool are always welcome with advance notice. An additional hourly fee of $9.00 will be charged for this service.

#Illness
If a child has visible signs of an illness while at school we will notify the parent so that they can make arrangements to pick up their child. We will do our best to comfort your child until you arrive. State licensing requires all ill children to be isolated as soon as possible in the school office or nursery so they do not expose the other children. If parents cannot be reached, their emergency contact will be called. Please do not send your child to school if he/she has a fever ( I 00 degrees or above), vomiting, diarrhea, runny discolored mucus nose, sore throat, inflamed eyes or undiagnosed rash. Please notify the school if your child has a contagious disease.

#Medications
Medication will not be administered by Where The Garden Grow's staff. Parents may administer medications as required or prescribed at anytime during the school day. The only exception will be for children that require the occasional use of asthma inhalers or an Epi- Pen (stored in a First Aid Kit). Please contact the office if your child will need an inhaler or Epi -Pen at school to complete a medication form and parental authorization. Written consent must be provided from the parent, permitting the preschool facility personnel to administer Epi-Pen or inhaler to the child. Parent must demonstrate on how to administer medication. As per licensing rules and regulations no medication is allowed in the possession of students.

#Injury /Accident
In the event of a minor accident such as scratches, bumps, bruises, minor cuts, bug bites, first aid measures will be taken. An Accident Report Form will be completed, signed by the teacher and director. The original copy will go home with the child for parent to sign and return. Parents will be called if deemed necessary for medical attention.

#In Case of Emergency
In the event of a serious medical or dental emergency we will make every effort to contact child's parents or guardian. When parent or guardian cannot be reached, Where The Garden Grows will call an ambulance to transfer child to the nearest emergency hospital or other location designated on "Consent for Emergency Form" signed by parent. A staff member will remain with the child until parent or guardian arrives. Please notify the office of any changes on your emergency form.

#Guidance & Discipline
We believe it is our responsibility to guide, correct and socialize children toward appropriate behaviors. Positive guidance and discipline are crucial because it promotes children's self control, teaches them responsibility and helps them make thoughtful choices. The more effective we are at encouraging appropriate child behavior the less time we spend correcting children's misbehavior. Effective guidance and discipline focus on the development of the child. We want to project positive guidance and discipline techniques by:
* Setting clear and consistent rules and consequences
* Encourage self-control by providing meaningful choices
* Focus on the desired behavior, rather than the one to be avoided
* Build children's images of themselves as trustworthy, respectful, responsible, fair, caring and cooperative (citizenship)
* Expect the best from the child
* Help children see how their actions affect others
* Help children resolve conflict (problem -solving) and cope with their feelings

If in the event a child needs to be separated from his/her peers we will use "take ten". It is an effective strategy to slow or clam down and regain control. Child counts to ten and re-enters a situation in a positive way. If a child bites it will be documented and child sent to office. A phone call to the parent will be made and documented. If biting behavior continues the child will be excluded for one day. Biting is unacceptable behavior and child may not be able to return to school if it persist. In no circumstance will students be disciplined with corporal or unusual punishment. Behavior that is unsafe for other students or our staff will result in a child's dismissal from our program.

#Field Trips
Parents will be notified in writing of scheduled field trips in advance. A permission slip must be signed and returned to the classroom teacher prior to field trip. Special field trips may require an additional fee. Participation in field trips is counted as a regular school day. Parents are encouraged to accompany us on all field trips. The school does not provide transportation for field trips.

#Birthdays
Birthdays are a special event to all students. If parents would like to send a special birthday snack for their child's class please let your teacher know in advance so that she can plan accordingly. We suggest healthy snacks, such as bagels & cream cheese, fresh fruit, mini muffins, cheese, crackers, fruit juice bars or yogurt. No cake, cupcakes or ice cream please. We ask that you hold birthday parties outside the school and mail all birthday invitations directly to your child's classmates. You may obtain a class directory in school office.

#Show and Share
Teachers appreciate unit related materials. Children are encouraged to bring items that relate to monthly teaching themes. These items are to remain in cubbies until sharing time. Your child's teacher will communicate specific show and share routines. Please remember toy guns, toy war weapons, candy and money are prohibited and should be left at home.
